        <h4>Final will</h4>
        <p class="post">          
        Srila Prabhupada considered the sale of a temple a matter of such weighty concern that he wrote in his final will that in principle temples should never be sold and he devoted most of his will to the protection of ISKCON temple properties. In a room conversations about the making of his will, he mentioned three times to "never sell a temple."</p>

            <blockquote>"My dear Satsvarupa,
.... I have heard from Bhagavan dasa that you want to move the deities from Detroit. That is not a very good proposal. In general, deities are never removed from one place to another simply for show. Once the deity is installed in India, it can never be removed under any circumstances, even they must build the highway around it. But in our case we may sometimes have to change houses, so we may once have to move the deity from one house to another, but we shall not move them from one city to another just for our own convenience. We are always thinking these kind of changes, why is that? I simply want things to be developed which we have got, not to make so many big big plans and changing all the time, that is not very practical." <cite>Ref. VedaBase => Letter to: Satsvarupa -- Paris 25 July, 1972</cite>
