                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
               Srila Prabhupada first began his Society in a small storefront in New York’s lower East Side at 26 2nd Ave (and give date: in such and such year). In 196? the temple shifted down the street to a larger place at 61 2nd Ave. From there the temple shifted again in 196/ to (such and such street in Brooklyn) [or better, shifted to a large brownstone at such and such address].
               </p>
               <p> 
                As the temple continued to grow, in 1975 It moved again, this time to midtown Manhattan, where the devotees purchased an [XX] story building at 340 West 55th street, a few blocks from Columbus circle. SP was very pleased with this temple and told the devotees, “never sell it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                But somehow in 19? the devotees did sell it. The building was costly to run and the leaders had the idea that by splitting into three locations, one in Manhattan, one in New Jersey, and one in Upstate New York the society could be more effective.
                <p>
                But things didn’t work out as planned. The Upstate property failed. The New Jersey location didn’t fulfil the purpose for which it had been envisioned, and with the funds from the sale of the building, in 1981 the devotees were able to acquire a building on 7th Ave. that proved woefully too small for the temple’s activities. The hopeful plan had turned into a disaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                Finally the devotees sold the cramped 7th Ave location and used it to buy a place that was large enough for their needs and cheap enough to afford. This was in a rundown, crime-ridden area of downtown Brooklyn.
